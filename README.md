Get you email handy as you will receive a confirmation code.

Follow the steps to:

- Enter the name of your team (My Bikes & Ski)
- Add your name
- No need to invite anybody for now (we are just testing, click on Skip this step)
- Enter what team is working on and this will create a new channel (sales research)
- Start with the Limited Free Version

With this you should be able to have your first Slack Channel!
