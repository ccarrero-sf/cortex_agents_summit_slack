Get you email handy as you will receive a confirmation code.

Follow the steps to:

- Enter the name of your team (My Bikes & Ski)
- Add your name
- No need to invite anybody for now (we are just testing, click on Skip this step)
- Enter what team is working on and this will create a new channel (sales research)
- Start with the Limited Free Version

With this you should be able to have your first Slack Channel!

## 2. Create a Slack App.

This is the App that will be calling Cortex Agents API.

Click on [Create Apps](https://api.slack.com/apps?new_app=1)

Click on Create New App -> Select From scratch

Give the app a name and select the workspace you just created:
